### About us:

Dear friends,

We understand that many of you, as owners of this device, face the issue of accessing the repositories. Due to this, it is impossible to update the list of packages and important tools needed for the device's operation.
In order to solve this issue, we have made a backup copy of the main repositories for the Nokia N900 with the Maemo 5 operating system (Fremantle distribution). This backup has been uploaded to our servers in Russia.

## The current addresses are:
```
# Main Repo Dir
http://repository.maemo.sbs/

# Nokia APP
#deb http://repository.maemo.sbs/nokia/fremantle/ssu/apps/ ./


```
 (list will be updated after server update)


Yours faithfully,
The Maemo Team
